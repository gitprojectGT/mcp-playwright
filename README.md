## MoviePageHelper Configuration

The `MoviePageHelper` class now supports custom configuration to adapt to different applications, environments, or UI variations:

### Basic Usage (Default Configuration)
```typescript
import { MoviePageHelper } from './helpers/MoviePageHelper';

// Uses default configuration for the movie app
const moviePage = new MoviePageHelper(page);
```

### Custom Configuration
```typescript
import { MoviePageHelper, MoviePageConfig } from './helpers/MoviePageHelper';

const customConfig: MoviePageConfig = {
  baseUrl: 'https://staging-movie-app.com',
  searchButtonText: 'Find Movies',
  darkModeSymbol: 'üåô',
  lightModeSymbol: '‚òÄÔ∏è',
  loadingText: 'Loading movies...'
};

const moviePage = new MoviePageHelper(page, customConfig);
```

### Use Cases

1. **Different Environments**: Test against staging, production, or local environments
2. **Internationalization**: Support different languages and locales
3. **UI Variations**: Adapt to different themes or symbol sets
4. **A/B Testing**: Test different UI variations with the same test logic

## Running Tests

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm ci
```

Install Playwright browsers:
```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Run tests with Allure reporting:
```bash
npm run test:allure
```

Generate Allure report:
```bash
npm run allure:generate
```

Serve Allure report:
```bash
npm run allure:serve
```

## Allure Reporting

This project uses Allure for comprehensive test reporting with the following features:

- **Rich Test Reports**: Visual reports with test execution details, screenshots, and logs
- **Test Analytics**: Historical data, trends, and flaky test detection
- **Integration**: Automatically generated in CI/CD pipeline
- **Artifacts**: Test results and reports are saved as GitHub Actions artifacts

### Available Scripts

- `npm run test:allure` - Run tests with Allure reporter
- `npm run allure:generate` - Generate static HTML report from results
- `npm run allure:serve` - Start local server to view report
- `npm run allure:open` - Open generated report in browser

## CI/CD

The test workflow runs in two stages with Allure reporting:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Runs tests in `tests/unit/` directory
   - Must pass before integration tests can start
   - Generates both HTML and Allure reports
   - Artifacts: "unit-test-report", "unit-allure-report", "unit-allure-results"

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Runs only after unit tests pass
   - Executes all non-unit tests
   - Can be run on different browsers (chromium/firefox/webkit)
   - Generates both HTML and Allure reports
   - Artifacts: "integration-test-report", "integration-allure-report", "integration-allure-results"
   - Test report available as "integration-test-report" artifact

Tests are automatically run on:
- Every push to `master` branch
- Every pull request to `master` branch

### Manual Trigger
You can manually trigger the tests through GitHub Actions:
1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Click on "Playwright Tests" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Select the browser for integration tests (chromium/firefox/webkit)
5. Click "Run workflow" to start the tests

Both unit test and integration test reports are available in the GitHub Actions artifacts for each run.
